# AWS Security Workshop with Dome9 
This security workshop is designed to help you get familiar with common security misconfigurations in AWS and learn how to identify and remediate threats in your environment as you scale your workloads in the cloud.

As part of the lab, you will be given a sandbox AWS environment (filled with security exposures!) to explore and learn how you can use Dome9 to easily detect and remediate common security challenges.

<b>Format</b>

- Overview presentation and lab setup, followed by paced exercises with a section recap. 
- The organizing team is comprised of one speaker and 1-2 technical staff to help out and answer questions
- Participants bring their own laptops and have an AWS account setup (preferably beforehand) - Please do this early on since it takes a few hours for a new AWS account to sync with a CFT template


<b>Target Audience:</b> Technical security users (security engineers, architects, DevOps) who have heard of Dome9 and know what Dome9 offers

<b>Prerequisites</b>

You should have some level of familiarity with AWS services such as EC2, VPC, S3, and Security Groups. Exposure to AWS CloudFormation is a bonus. Some experience working with the AWS console is helpful as well.

<b>Scenario</b>

Your company recently performed a lift-and-shift of your production infrastructure into AWS. You are a security administrator and have been tasked with security monitoring within your AWS environment. As part of that, you are also responsible for detecting and fixing any misconfigurations in your environment.

<b>Architecture Overview</b>

For this workshop you will have multiple EC2 instances (simulating app workloads, RDS databases) and services such as ELBs, ALBs, S3 buckets etc setup in the us-west-2 region and your team has configured the security group rules and microsegmentation policies for the respective services.
